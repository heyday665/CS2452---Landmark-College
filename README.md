# CS2452---Landmark-College

# This repository contains the four following 'sub-repositories' as of 2/28/16:
#     -assign1: A basic Java introductory assignment. Includes three programs (P1, P2, P3), which do various tasks.
#         -P1: Basic introduction into the use of an 'args' variable and print statements.
#         -P2: Program that takes integers from user input, and (while keeping track of the max and min) finds the average.
#         -P3: A recursive program that will print all permutations of a string passed in by the user.

#     -assign2: A rudimentary, unthreaded, chat client with a seperate process for server/client

#     -threading-assign3: An improvement off of assign2, implementing threading to allow for both reading and writing to the socket at 'the same time'.

#     -producerconsumer: A successful attempt at mitigating the effects of the 'producers / consumers' synchronization problem with the use of Semaphores.

#     -skipee-assign5: A voice chat program similar to Skype, with a GUI. Written with the help of SWING for Java.
